# Languages

## Human

Spanish, Mandarin, Latin, some Persian and French, reading knowledge of Classical/Koiné Greek and most Romance languages, grammatical knowledge of many Indo-European languages, Korean, and others.

## Machine

Python, Perl, R, PHP, Matlab/GNU Octave, bash/shell, some superficial knowledge of C, common LISP and Haskel; markup languages including LaTeX, XeLaTeX , R Markdown, HTML and CSS.

# Computing

## Code

+ mutt and offlineIMAP wizard. [Github](https://githib.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard).
: A tool for setting up a fully featured personal mail system and offlineIMAP server, with GPG secured passwords, server detection and support for notmuch mail indexing and autosyncing with notification.
+ shortcut-sync. [Github](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/shortcut-sync).
+ Corpus Latinum Lucae. [Github](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/corpus-latinum).
: (Still in progress.) A planned Latin corpus to be searchable by regexes. Right now, I've developed a part of speech tagger based on Whitacker's WORDS and some systems for converting Latin HTML files into tagged text documents.
+ voidrice. [Github](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).
: My most popular item on Github, dotfiles for an i3-gaps based Linux system. This is my personal config which is employed by LARBS.
+ LARBS (Luke's Auto-Ricing Bootstrapping Scripts). [Github](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/larbs). [Website](https://larbs.xyz).
: A series of scripts that automatically configures a full-featured vim and i3-gaps-based GNU/Linux system on Arch Linux or derived distributions.

## Tools I Use

I have lots of tutorials on many of these programs and tools on my [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz).

### Usual Workflow

I use a **vim**-based setup in a tiling window manager (**i3-gaps**). I compile documents using **R Markdown** or **LaTeX**, and **biber** for references.
I prefer multimedia manipulation in the terminal with tools like **imagemagick** and **ffmpeg** for extensibilitiy's sake.
I've run Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux systems (both Debian and Arch-based varieties, as well as Void Linux).

### Programs I'm familiar with.

tmux, ssh, RStudio, Blender (mostly for video-editing), Praat, Audacity, E-Prime, GIMP, pandoc, Jupyter. I've managed websites manually via ssh and vim using HTML/CSS/PHP and with tools such as Github Pages (Jekyll) WordPress via either cpanel or wp-cli. Some experience with myBB.


# Writings

On the HTML version, scroll over for a summary.

+ A Critique of "Reason". [PDF](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/critique-of-reason/blob/master/rational.pdf).
: A critique of the "Heuristics and Biases" approach to cognition usually associated withe Kahnemann and Tversky. I argue for a variety of ecological rationality, stating that tendencies which seem irrational in experimental conditions are not in the real world, but also that heuristics and biases are all constuable as mental *models* which differ only in scale, where there are often negative returns to scale, making simple heuristics preferable to so-called "optimization".

+ Scope Without Syntax: A Game Theoretic Approach. [PDF](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/scope-without-syntax/blob/master/prelim2.pdf).
: Second qualifying paper. 2017.
: A Game Theoretic analysis of quantifier scope, arguing that possible scope interpretations fall out from pragmatic assumptions about speaker/hearer intention. One empirical claim is that syntactic rigidity should universally correlate with scope ambiguity, while flexible languages/constructions tend to be scopally non-ambiguous.

+ Syntax Without Syntax. [PDF](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/syntax-without-syntax/blob/master/prelim.pdf).
: First qualifying paper. 2017.
: Language differences in syntactic word order can be modeled as falling out from otherwise independent prosodic constraints (modeled Optimality Theoretically). Each language has a prosodic pattern and sentential constituents are placed optimally in that template. This avoid grammar overgeneralization that occurs in Halle and Vergnaud.

+ External Possession and the Undisentanglability of Syntax and Semantics. [PDF](https://lukesmith.xyz/thesis.pdf).
: Master's Thesis. 2015.
: Many languages have external possession constructions which may be possessive datives, incorporated possessa or other types, but all with an affected possessor abide by subtlely similar syntactic constraints, always disallowing EP from agentive clauses. This is argued to be due to an inherent thematic/semantic hierarchy in the "syntax".

+ Indo-European Particles and Head-Movement-driven Word Order Change. [PDF](https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/ling/luke_pie_wordorder.pdf).
: An informal squib arguing that word order differences in Indo-European languages were historically telegraphed by particle placement, and verbs moved to unify with particles. I.e. languages with initial  particles gradually shifted to be VSO, languages with second position particles moved to being V2 and later SVO.

+ Scope Markings and Series Phrase Parsing. [PDF](https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/ling/luke_scopemarking.pdf).
: A crazy idea about scope marking, arguing that if we take a serial approach to prosodification, the vexxing construction of scope marking may in fact be a repair strategy to meet a general desire of the language faculty to group together a question word with where it takes scope, based on an intuition similar to N. Richards' Contiguity Theory.

+ Syntax is Just a Phonological Construct! [PDF](https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/ling/luke_worder.pdf).
: A precursor write-up to the "Syntax without syntax" paper above.

+ Some countercyclic problems at the nexus of phonology and syntax. [PDF](https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/ling/luke_countercyclic.pdf).
: A brief write-up ennumerating some aspects of syntax which are tied into prosody/phonology/semantics and how generally they produce counter-cyclicity problems for Generative Grammar and any "Y-modeled" grammar.
+ Accomodating phonological structure: Extraposition, the EPP and trace effects. [PDF](https://lukesmith.xyz/dox/ling/luke_synphon.pdf).
: Probably the first "syntax is just phonology" paper I wrote, a term paper. I detail the mismatch between semantic and prosodic structure as the origin of syntactic movement, etc.
